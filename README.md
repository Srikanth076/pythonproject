# pythonproject
This Python project, Hierarchical Random Forest Classification Model, is designed to enhance classification accuracy by leveraging a hierarchical approach. It utilizes the Random Forest algorithm combined with a structured decision-making process, allowing for multi-level classification. The model is implemented using Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas, ensuring efficient data processing and training. To get started, clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git and install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt. The model can be trained and evaluated using python main.py. This project provides a scalable and interpretable classification framework suitable for complex datasets.
